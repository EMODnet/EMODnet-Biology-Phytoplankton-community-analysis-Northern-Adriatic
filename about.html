<h2> Data series </h2>
<p> The plankton series from the LTER site in the Northern Adriatic comprises three datasets in EMODnet biology: the phytoplankton series was started in 1986 and is continued until present. 
Results of the Microzooplankton series and Mesozooplankton series are available between 1998 and 2005. However, due to taxonomic problems, these datasets are currently not used. Also for the phytoplankton, uncertainty and changes over time in the identification at species level has led to the decision to present species grouped into genera as the lowest taxonomic level.</p>

The phytoplankton dataset can be retrieved from EMODNET biology. Its description reads "Phytoplankton North Adriatic-Gulf of Trieste LTER time-series". Downloads are possible through the data portal toolbox. We used abundance data only, as biomass is incomplete.


<p> The phytoplankton series is described in: 

<q>M. Cabrini, D. Fornasaro, G. Cossarini, M. Lipizer, D. Virgilio. 2012. Phytoplankton temporal changes in a coastal northern Adriatic site during the last
25 years. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 115: 113-124</q>
We refer to this paper for all details concerning sampling and working up of samples.</p>
<p> Details on the microzooplankton sampling at this site can be found in:
<q> M Monti, M. Minocci, L. Milani, S. F. Umani. 2012. Seasonal and interannual dynamics of microzooplankton abundances in the Gulf
of Trieste (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy). Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science.</q>
However, not all data described in this paper are available through EMODnet Biology. The exact relationship is still to be clarified.</p>

<h2> Data product </h2>
<p>We show the evolution over time of depth-averaged abundance of major groups of species, as well as the most frequent genera in the dataset. A frequency limit has been set to those groups and genera that have at least 20 occurrences during the course of the time series. The major groups are defined at the Class level. In the major groups, all species belonging to the group have been summed, also including the rare species that are not shown as separate species in the product.</p>
<p> In the <i>Yearly</i> series, we have averaged all data per year and present the results as box plots. When transformation is used (double square root transformation is offered), transformation has preceded the calculation of the box plots.</p>
<p> The <i>Monthly</i> series shows the average (over the years) monthly pattern of occurrence of the species or group. No distinction between several periods has been made.</p>
<p> the <i>Multivariate</i> representation of phytoplankton is based on a PCA of double square-root transformed genus abundances of the most frequent genera (the same genus set that is shown in the time series). We present a biplot of samples and genera, but we have grouped samples (and present centroids) in two different ways: per year and per season. This allows to show the long-term trend as a shift in yearly centroid (in red), and the seasonal fluctuation as variation between months (in blue). Both trends are at right angles in the biplot, suggesting little correlation between the seasonal and long-term fluctuations. The biplot further shows the scores of the genera as arrows from the origin. The genera selected and used to show yearly and monthly temporal variation, is/are highlighted in green in this graph. Upon selection of a new group or genus, this highlighting is dynamically adapted. Thus, the multivariate graph shows how the selected group or genus contributes to the temporal evolution of the community on long-term and seasonal scales</p>
<p> There is, as yet, no multivariate representation of microzooplankton or mesozooplankton composition. The field will be empty when a species in these groups is chosen.</p>
